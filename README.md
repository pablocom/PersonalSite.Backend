# PersonalSite Backend
### Microservice example for Domain Model pattern practice

![CI pipeline](https://github.com/pablocom/PersonalSite.Backend/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg?branch=master)

This project focuses on application of patterns, principles, and practices of Domain-Driven Design. Making the domain agnostic from infrastructure implementations (Dependency Inversion principle), segregating business domain logic complexity from technical complexity. This project focuses on Domain-Model pattern and it stills evolution as I used it to get my hands dirty from what I read in the books.

I'd truly apreciate honest feedback ;)

Inspired by the reading of Patterns, principles and practices of Domain-Driven Design by Scott Millet and Nick Tune.
