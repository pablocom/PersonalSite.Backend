This project focuses on application of patterns, principles, and practices of Domain-Driven Design. More accurately on Domain-Model pattern. It stills evolution as I used it to get my hands dirty from what I read in the books.

I'd truly apreciate honest feedback ;)

Inspired by the reading of Patterns, principles and practices of Domain-Driven Design by Scott Millet and Nick Tune.
