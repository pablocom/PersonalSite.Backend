This project focuses on application of patterns, principles, and practices of Domain-Driven Design. Making the domain agnostic from infrastructure implementations, segregating business logic complexity from technical complexity. Using ubitiquous language to generate a rich domain verbosity that allows to collaborate throught domain knowledge.

Inspired by the reading of Patterns, principles and practices of Domain-Driven Design by Scott Millet and Nick Tune.
